#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <footer>
#
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             *   🎉 : initial commit
#             *  ✨ : feat:     A new feature
#             *  🐛 : bug:      A bug fix
#             *  🗑️  : remove
#             *  ♻  : refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#             *  💚 : test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#             *  💬 : comment
#             *  🎨 : style:    Style ui/ux change that do not affect the meaning of the code
#             *  📖 : doc:      Documentation only changes
#             *  🔖 : tag
#             *  🔧 : tool
#             * 👮  : lint
#             *  🐎 : perf:     A code change that improves performance
#             * build:          Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
#             * ci:             Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
#             * chore:          (maintain)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in
#    imperative present tense
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that
#    this commit closes
#
# Thank you <3
