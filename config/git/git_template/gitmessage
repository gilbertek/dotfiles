# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit
# messages:
#
#     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <body>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <footer>
#
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * build:    Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
#             * ci:       Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
#             * chore:    (maintain)
#             * docs:     Documentation only changes
#             * feat:     A new feature
#             * fix:      A bug fix
#             * perf:     A code change that improves performance
#             * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#             * test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#             * style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in
#    imperative present tense
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that
#    this commit closes

# Thank you <3
